\usage{
selectK(SCobject, K_set = 2:10, criterion = "BIC", c = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{SCobject}{is an object generated from SC.MEB function.}

\item{K_set}{is a integer vector used in SC.MEB. The default is 2:10}

\item{criterion}{is a character specifying the criterion for selecting K. The default value is BIC. The alternative value MBIC can also be used.}

\item{c}{is a positive value in the modified BIC. The default is 1.
Here we briefly explain how to choose the parameter c in the modified BIC. In general, For the ST or Visium dataset, it often ranges from 0.4 to 1 while for the MERFISH dataset with large number of cells, it often becomes larger, for example 10,20. Most importantly, SC-MEB is fast, scaling well in terms of sample size, which allow the user to tune the c based on their prior knowledge about the tissues or cells.}
