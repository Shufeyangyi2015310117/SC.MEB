Description: Spatial clustering with hidden markov random field fitted via EM algorithm, details of which can be found in Yi Yang (2021) <doi:10.1101/2021.06.05.447181>. It is not only computationally efficient and scalable to the sample size increment, but also is capable of choosing the smoothness parameter and the number of clusters as well.
