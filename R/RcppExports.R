#' getneighborhood_fast
#' @description
#' an efficient function to find the neighborhood based on the matrix of position and a pre-defined cutoff
#'
#' @param x is a n-by-2 matrix of position.
#' @param cutoff is a threashold of Euclidean distance to decide whether a spot is an neighborhood of another spot. For example, if the Euclidean distance between spot A and B is less than cutoff, then A is taken as the neighbourhood of B. 
#' @return A sparse matrix containing the neighbourhood
#'
