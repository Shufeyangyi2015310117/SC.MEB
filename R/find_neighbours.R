#' @details find_neighbors2 was used to find the neighborhood of spot. 
#' @param sce is a SingleCellExperiment object containing PCA and position informatin. 
#' @param platform is the name of spatial transcriptomic platform. Specify 'Visium' for hex lattice geometry or 'ST' for square lattice geometry. Specifying this parameter is optional as this information is included in their metadata.
